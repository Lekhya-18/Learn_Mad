# 📱 Android Application Components 
## 📌 What is an Android Component?
- An Android component is a **basic building block** of an Android application.
- Each component has a specific role and helps the app to perform different tasks like UI display, background work, data sharing, and system event handling.

👉 In simple words:
>Android app = combination of different components working together.

# 🔷 Main Android Components
> Android has 4 main components:
## 🔹 1. Activity
👉 An Activity represents a **single screen** of the app.
- Example: Login Screen, Home Screen, Profile Screen.
#### Role:
- Handles UI (User Interface)
- Takes user input
- Interacts with user
## 🔹 2. Service
👉 A Service runs in the **background without UI.**
- Example:
Music playing in background, File downloading, Location tracking
#### Role:
- Performs long-running tasks
- Works even when app is not visible
## 🔹 3. Broadcast Receiver
👉 It listens for **system-wide events** and reacts to them.
- Example: Battery low alert, Airplane mode ON/OFF, Incoming SMS
#### Role:
- Responds to system or app events
- Does not run continuously
## 🔹 4. Content Provider
👉 It is used to **share data** between different apps.
- Example: Contacts access, Gallery images. Media files
#### Role:
- Manages and shares app data securely
- Allows inter-app data communication
